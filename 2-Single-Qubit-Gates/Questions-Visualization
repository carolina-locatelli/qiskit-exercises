SINGLE QUBIT GATE VISUALIZATION

Plot the following in your jupyter notebooks and observe the result:
Consider having 2 qubits which means q0,q1. 
Apply:
H gate to qubit 0
Z gate to qubit 1
Y gate to qubit 0

The question remains the same.
Apply:
X gate to qubit 0
S gate to qubit 0
Z gate to qubit 1
